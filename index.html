        <p>Nutrition – is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth.</p>
        <p>Eating healthy is just making sure that you provide yourself with a balanced diet that contains all the seven factors that you need to stay fit or grow stronger. These seven factors include carbs, proteins, fats, fibre, vitamins, minerals and water. A lot of these will already be in your diet but the hard part is knowing which are good and bad and need to be cut down or increased. 
        Although, you don’t want too much or too little of these you need to find the right equilibrium for your body. As a performing artist, the proportions will change slightly as we need more slow-burning carbs to get us through a full day of training and more proteins to rebuild and strengthen our muscle fibres that have ripped. 
        Additionally, a healthy diet can help prevent us from injury, reducing fatigue and increase our energy levels and therefore our performance. If we as performers neglect our diets then we will be on the back foot of the competitive industry that we are trying to get hired in. 
        Just by not having enough carbs you will suffer from a lack of energy and attentiveness that panels will be looking for as soon as you walk in the door for an audition, losing you the job before you’ve even started to showcase your talent. A lot of this information can be found online but not all of it is reliable and factual. 
        The best way to find reliable information is the find reputable sources (such as national health organisations or scientific papers focused on the performing arts or athletes), you then take the information you gather from these sources and cross-reference them by comparing them to each other to see if the information matches up, then you’ll start to know in the information you’ve learnt in reliable.

Add the broccoli, then return the water to the boil and cook for 4 minutes more, until the broccoli is on the firm side of just tender. Drain well.</li>
              <li>While the pasta is cooking, put the butter, flour and milk in a large pan and heat, whisking or stirring continuously, until it thickens to make a smooth sauce.

              <li>Halve the salmon fillets widthways then place the pieces in a single layer on the base of the ovenproof dish. Spoon the broccoli mixture on top, then scatter with the grated cheddar. </li>
              <li>Bake for 30 minutes until the mixture is just starting to bubble round the edges and the mixture is pale golden – don’t let it go too dark or the fish will overcook.</li>
